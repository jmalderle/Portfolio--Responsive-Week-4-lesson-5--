<p>Shut your filthy mouth, I'm not that kind of girl. Let's go. What? Thank god I still got my hair. What on Earth is that thing I'm wearing? Oh, I've been so worried about you ever since you ran off the other night. Are you okay? I'm sorry I have to go. Isn't he a dream boat?
Hello, Jennifer. Right, I got it. Marty, don't be such a square. Everybody who's anybody drinks. Oh, just a little weather experiment. Don't worry. As long as you hit that wire with the connecting hook at precisely 88 miles per hour, the instance the lightning strikes the tower, everything will be fine.
Hey McFly, what do you think you're doing. I guess you guys aren't ready for that yet. But your kids are gonna love it. George, buddy. remember that girl I introduced you to, Lorraine. What are you writing? Shit. Unroll their fire.
What was it, George, bird watching? Oh. Why do you keep following me around? Uh, Lorraine. How did you know I was here? I'm too loud. I can't believe it. I'm never gonna get a chance to play in front of anybody.
Just turn around, McFly, and walk away. Are you deaf, McFly? Close the door and beat it. Hello, hello, anybody home? Think, McFly, think. I gotta have time to get them re-typed. Do you realize what would happen if I hand in my reports in your handwriting. I'll get fired. You wouldn't want that to happen would you? Would you? I don't know, but I'm gonna find out. A block passed Maple, that's John F. Kennedy Drive. Don't say a word.
